# BitOptimizer

Crappy little terminal program to show you the coins/bit of stuff. Has a few issues

- Does not leverage historical data (Price spikes will falsely show items as being optimal and vice versa)
- Poor averaging for bazaar items (it doesn't)
- Terminal only (idk idc but others def do)

## Setup

Just run:

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running

Literally just `python run.py`, enter your API key to forever save it into `hypixel_api_persistent.json` (NEVER SHARE YOUR API KEY OR THAT FILE !!), and wait for results to come in from the auction house

## Contributing

You can but no promises I pull it unless:
- I feel it's an appropriate addition
- It works
- Doesn't introduce tech debt
- Isn't overly complicated / unmaintainable

## Reporting Issues

You can also do this, no promises it gets fixed though
